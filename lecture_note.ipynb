    "# Introduction to Coroutines\n",
    "\n",
    "Coroutines are an interesting mechanism in several programming languages, useful for asynchronous or event driven programming in fields like networking, operating systems, user interfaces and industrial/embedded systems. One thing shared by these applications is that execution may be triggered by external input, and we might want a new paradigm outside imperative, functional and logical programming to handle these cases - thus, the need for asynchronous programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coroutines are functions whose execution can be stopped and continued while maintaining internal state. They generalize the subroutines (i.e. functions) we're familiar with, because normal subroutines only start in one place and end in another. On the other hand, coroutines can be stopped and restarted many times during execution, entering and exiting the body of the function in several places.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to frame this discussion is through the simulation of a cake factory.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cake factory is represented as a machine with:\n",
    "- **INPUT**: Raw Ingredients like flour 🌾 and sugar 🍬, delivered at random times and\n",
    "- **OUTPUT**: Delicious cake 🎂. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within this cake factory are smaller machines that take in precursor ingredients and output precursors to other machines, a pipeline to eventually obtain a cake at the end. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using **coroutines** and **generators** (Generators are a subclass of coroutines, discussed further on) to simulate the operations of a cake factory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## So how do we make a cake?\n",

    "**Dry Ingredients** - 2 Flour, 3 Sugar, 2 Chocolate\n",

    "1. Melt the Butter\n",
    "2. Mix wet ingredients when you have enough, and turn it into wet mix\n",
    "3. Mix dry ingredients when you have enough, and turn it into dry mix\n",
    "4. Combine wet and dry ingredients, and bake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tasks can be paralleled, and some must be done serially.\n",

    "Coroutines and generators are useful mechanisms to asynchronous/event driven programming tasks using a familiar syntax and the keyword `yield` which halts execution, \"yielding back\" control to the outer context (continuation) of the coroutine. They maintain state and can be used to implement many useful asynchronous programming applications like pipelines with wide applications in many domains handling real-world interaction."
